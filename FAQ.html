      <h3>1. What is the definition of freedom, and how does it vary across different countries and cultures?</h3>
      <span class="arrow">&#9660;</span>
    </div>
    <p class="answer">Freedom can be defined as the power or right to act, speak, or think without restraint. However, the concept of freedom varies across different countries and cultures based on factors such as political systems, social norms, and religious beliefs. In some societies, freedom may be primarily focused on individual rights, while in others, it may be more closely tied to collective well-being or adherence to certain values.</p>

      <h3>2. How is the freedom score measured?</h3>
      <span class="arrow">&#9660;</span>
    </div>
    <p class="answer"> A country or territory is awarded 0 to 4 points for each of 10 political rights indicators and 15 civil liberties indicators, which take the form of questions; a score of 0 represents the smallest degree of freedom and 4 the greatest degree of freedom. The political rights questions are grouped into three subcategories: Electoral Process (3 questions), Political Pluralism and Participation (4), and Functioning of Government (3). The civil liberties questions are grouped into four subcategories: Freedom of Expression and Belief (4 questions), Associational and Organizational Rights (3), Rule of Law (4), and Personal Autonomy and Individual Rights (4). The political rights section also contains an additional discretionary question addressing forced demographic change. For the discretionary question, a score of 1 to 4 may be subtracted, as applicable (the worse the situation, the more points may be subtracted). The highest overall score that can be awarded for political rights is 40 (or a score of 4 for each of the 10 questions). The highest overall score that can be awarded for civil liberties is 60 (or a score of 4 for each of the 15 questions).</p>

      <h3>5. What role does education play in promoting freedom and empowering individuals?</h3>
      <span class="arrow">&#9660;</span>
    </div>
    <p class="answer">Education is a key factor in promoting freedom and empowering individuals to exercise their rights and participate in society. By providing people with knowledge and skills, education can help them make informed decisions, think critically about issues affecting their lives, and advocate for change. Education can also promote values such as tolerance, respect for diversity, and civic engagement, which are essential for building free and democratic societies. Ensuring access to quality education for all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances, is crucial for promoting freedom and social progress.</p>
